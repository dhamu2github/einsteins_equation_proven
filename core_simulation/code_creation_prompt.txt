Objective
Create an interactive educational visualization that begins with a familiar, everyday process—boiling water and steam condensation—and transitions into a conceptual and quantitative demonstration of Einstein’s famous equation E = mc², helping users intuitively grasp the principle of mass-energy equivalence.

Step 1: Boiling Water and Steam Condensation
Setup:
Simulate a pot of water being heated on a stove.

Show heat energy transferring to water molecules, increasing their kinetic energy.

Animate the phase change from liquid to gas (vaporization), and back to liquid (condensation).

Key Features:
Display heat energy required for boiling (e.g., latent heat of vaporization: 2260 J/g).

During condensation, show heat being released to the surroundings.

Visualization:
Use molecule animations to show movement increasing with heat.

Represent energy flow with arrows or color coding (e.g., red for heat input, blue for heat release).

Step 2: Conceptual Transition to E = mc²
Introduce Mass-Energy Equivalence:
Pose an interactive question:
“What if we could convert even a tiny bit of water’s mass into pure energy?”

Calculation Example:
For 1 gram of water:
E = 0.001 kg × (3 × 10⁸ m/s)² = 9 × 10¹³ joules

Contextual Comparison:
Visualize this energy equivalent to:
“Enough to power millions of homes for a day”

Interactive Feature:
Add a slider/input box where users can enter mass (in grams or kilograms).

Instantly calculate and display the resulting energy using E = mc².

Visually represent the enormous energy potential of small mass values.

Step 3: Extreme Example – Nuclear Reactions
Mass-to-Energy Conversion Simulation:
Transition from boiling water to nuclear scenarios.

Show nuclear fission (e.g., uranium splitting) or fusion (e.g., hydrogen fusing into helium).

Key Visualization:
Show a small amount of mass “disappearing” during the reaction and reappearing as radiant energy (light/heat).

Use E = mc² to calculate energy released during the process.

Step 4: Real-World Applications
Energy Comparison:
Compare boiling water (thermal energy transfer) vs. nuclear reaction (mass-to-energy conversion).

Highlight applications like:

Nuclear power plants

Starlight and solar energy

Particle-antiparticle annihilation

Interactive Exploration:
Let users toggle between scenarios:

Heat transfer (boiling)

Full mass-to-energy conversion

Nuclear reactions

Provide energy outputs and comparisons for each.

Final Output:
An engaging, layered educational simulation that:

Starts with familiar phenomena

Bridges into conceptual physics

Quantifies Einstein’s equation

Ends with real-world, high-impact applications
